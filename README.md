## Quantum Computing, Data Science, and AI Project

This repository contains materials and code related to the Quantum Computing, Data Science, and AI project, focusing on data science techniques applied to a real-world dataset.

### Overview

This project demonstrates data science workflows, including data cleaning, geo-enrichment, network analysis, and visualization, using the undersea cable dataset.

The project includes a visualization of undersea cables across the globe:

### Contents

*   **`undersea_cables_world.png`:** A static map visualization of the undersea cable network generated by the `1-data-preparation.ipynb` notebook.
*   **`data/`:** Contains both the data generated by the analysis, as well as the `ne_110m_admin_0_countries` shapefile used for creating the world basemap in the visualizations. (Data from Natural Earth).
*   **`notebooks/`:** Contains the notebooks used for preparing, visualizing and analyzing the data (e.g., **`1-data-preparation.ipynb`:** data loading and cleaning and visualization of undersea cables.)
*   **`README.md`:** This file, providing an overview of the project.
